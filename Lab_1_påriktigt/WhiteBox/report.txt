Thorugh testing we found the following bugs, 

insert, would add the same element again if it already existed! 

intersect, would not "intersect" if the first element in objects own arraylist was bigger than
    the first element in the input set.

DistictClosed, the nested forloop started at j=i, meaning that if we used a binary operator that is not
    commutative we would miss some cases and therefore we could return true even though it was not true.

WE COULD NOT SETUP BRANCH COVERAGE THROUGH VSCODE, WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO SET IT UP!!!
    we tried with intellij but our structure that we had in vscode did not work there :( 
        aka not a mavenProject that intellij can interperet.
