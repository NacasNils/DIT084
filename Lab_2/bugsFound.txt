3.4 Bugs found
inbetween line 34 and 35 we have found a Bug.
if we input the values 1 1 1 1 the program will assign the value 31
to someDayInYear. and 0 to laterDayInYear. i belive the program then
performs the subtraction laterDayInYear - someDayInYear == 0 - 31 = -31
this is no correct.

We dont know why we assignt 31 to someDayInYear
