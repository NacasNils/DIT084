Answer Question 1b here:
  Let S: wp(if (x > y) then a := x AND b := y 
            else a := y AND b := x, a > b) =

            (BY CONDITIONAL RULE)
            (x > y) -> wp(a := x AND b := y,a > b) 
            /\
            (x <= y) -> wp(a := y AND b := x, a > b)

            (BY ASSIGNMENT RULE)
            (x > y) -> (x > y) 
            /\ 
            (x <= y) -> (y > x) 
            (LAST STEP FAILS! since x = y but R says otherwise)
